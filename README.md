# Helioseismology
Ivan Gentile December 2021

This Repository contains the documents and code developed to solve a project for the Astrophysics Lab course from IST Lisboa. 

The VibingSun notebook is a standalone read which can introduce anyone to the field of Helioseismology. 
You are welcome to download it and modify as you like. 

I hope that you will enjoy finding more about our Sun!
